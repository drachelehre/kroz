# Welcome to Project: Kroz

This is a personal project of mine. 

It's an RPG game with:
- Combat
- Character creation and class system
- Experience and leveling system
- Double-sided roguelike elements

Curious about that last part? There's a reason for it: You're not controlling the character you created! 
You're training it to fight (You for now, PvP could be a thing)!
